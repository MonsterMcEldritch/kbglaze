    <h1> Kindgom's Bloodline Is Peak Fiction </h1>
    <p> Kingdom's bloodline is a Chinese webnovel written by Masterless Sword. It focuses on political intrigue as the
        protagonist attemps to navigate his complex identities as both a prince and an enemy of the world. While the
        political conflicts are sublime, what I appreciate most about it are the character and their exceptional,
        emotional developments. 
    </p>
    <p> One scene I particularly liked which displayed this strong characterization is when Thales Jadestar, the
        protagonist who is the prince of the fictional nation "Constellation", talked to his father, the king Kessel Jadestar, in the Jadestar Family Tomb. As his
        father narrates to Thales the stories of his dead siblings, parents, and uncle, Kessel's character which had
        previously appeared so distant and unbelievable is suddenly provided with emotional grounding and depth. This
        history of this figure who had seemed larger-than-life and inhuman is suddenly revealed, showing how he had been
        shaped into the man he is today. The emotional power of the scene does not end there, however. 
    </p>
    <p> Kessel was telling Thales this history due to his imminent acknowledgement as the legitimate crown prince (he
        was an illegitimate son). In that light, this scene, showing how his father's entire family was murdered,
        becomes a warning to Thales: a vision of life in the brutal, merciless world he is about to enter. This
        sentiment is verbalized in Kessel's concluding question to Thales: "Are you prepared to fight for Constellation,
        to die for Constellation, and to live for Constellation?" This sentence's subtle structure conveys an unbearably
        horrifying message: to <em>live</em> for Constellation is more difficult than to die for Constellation. This is the
        fundamental reality of the world Thales is about to enter. This is the genius of Kingdom's Bloodline's writing.
